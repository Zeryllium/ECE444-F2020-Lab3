Activity 3 (1 point): Briefly summarize the difference between SQL or NoSQL database.

SQL databases are based on a relational model while NoSQL databases are document-oriented or key-value databases.
While SQL databases store data in tables and have primary keys and foreign keys to relate data between tables, NoSQL
databases do not follow the relational model. The SQL approach distributes information across multiple tables while the
NoSQL method utilizes denormalization, reducing the number of tables but increasing data duplication.
