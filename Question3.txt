Briefly summarize the differences between Docker and Virtual Machine

A virtual machine is a completely virtual (guest) operating system running on top of a host OS. It requires a hypervisor
running on the host machine to virtualize all the hardware components that the guest OS requires. Because of this
virtualization, multiple VMs can run on top of a host OS at the same time. However, as each VM is a full copy of an
operating system, VMs tend to be very resource demanding; many components of the guest OS are unnecessary and unused as
most applications do not require the full breadth of OS-capable activities.

Docker Containers are more light-weight alternatives to VMs. While containers do virtualize the operating system
(albeit, the bare minimum OS), most of the other resources that are required by the OS, such as the kernel and
binaries, are shared with the host OS instead. This significantly reduces the overhead when running applications in the
container when compared to VMs, allowing for faster runtimes and smaller memory usages.
